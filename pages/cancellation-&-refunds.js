        Behide India believes in helping its customers as far as possible, and has therefore a
        liberal cancellation policy. Under this policy:
        <br />
        <br />
        Cancellations will be considered only if the request is made immediately after placing the
        order. However, the cancellation request may not be entertained if the orders have been
        communicated to the vendors/merchants and they have initiated the process of shipping them.
        <br />
        <br />
        Behide India does not accept cancellation requests for perishable items like flowers,
        eatables etc. However, refund/replacement can be made if the customer establishes that the
        quality of product delivered is not good.
        <br />
        <br /> In case of receipt of damaged or defective items please report the same to our
        Customer Service team. The request will, however, be entertained once the merchant has
        checked and determined the same at his own end. This should be reported within 2 days of
        receipt of the products.
        <br />
        <br /> In case you feel that the product received is not as shown on the site or as per your
        expectations, you must bring it to the notice of our customer service within 2 days of
        receiving the product. The Customer Service Team after looking into your complaint will take
        an appropriate decision.
        <br />
        <br /> In case of complaints regarding products that come with a warranty from
        manufacturers, please refer the issue to them.
        <br />
        <br /> In case of any Refunds approved by the Behide India, itâ€™ll take 6-8 days for the
        refund to be processed to the end customer.
